# LTI Attendance Tool

This is an LTI application that assists instructors in keeping attendance records for Canvas courses.

It was originally developed for the K-State Polytechnic Campus in Salina for use in aviation related courses. The FAA has some very strict attendance requirements for some classes. Contact time between instructors and students must be tracked down to the minute with some make-up time allowed, also tracked in minutes. This application provides a convenient place in Canvas to track contact time.

The FAA required minutely reporting feature is optional. If it is disabled, the application only tracks daily attendance and doesn't deal with make up time.

## Technologies Used in this project

- Spring MVC 4
- Maven 3.5.2
- Arquillian 1.11.11
- Java 11
- Wildfly 15.0.1
- Oracle Database (RDS 19)

## External Resources

### Web Services

This application talks to the Canvas API using the [Canvas API Library for Java](https://github.com/kstateome/canvas-api) and must be able to communicate with your Canvas instance (in the Amazon Cloud if hosted by Instructure) on port 443.

### Database

This application needs a database to store its information in. It was written to talk to an Oracle database. Making the persistence layer database agnostic Is a future goal. A data source must be supplied to the application via the Wildfly config. For details on how to configure this, see the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

## Application Set Up

Once this application is running, an LTI link has to be installed in Canvas to make it accessible to users.

To test in Development, follow steps in the ome_lti repository to create and use a dev instance.

Install LTI Attendance Application in Canvas:
_ Navigate to https://IP/attendance (where IP is the address of your dev instance, test server, or production server)
_ Follow the instructions on the page that is returned

See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for more (outdated) details on how to set up and install this application.
